# <center>Introduction to <span class="rainbow-text">Orchestration</span> and Airflow</center>

### Why Orchestration?

It allows different teams to work together towards a unified goal with a single applications rather than using separate tools to achieve the same goal. It reduces complexity and improves team communication. 

---

### Data orchestration definition:
The <span class="rainbow-text">coordination</span> and <span class="rainbow-text">automation</span> of data flow across various tools and systems to deliver quality data products and analytics.

What is the journey of modern data orchestration?

1) Pre-Unix Era
- Defined by:
  - Manual batch-processing and scheduling
  - The foundation of the idea and need of data orchestration and workflow management starting to form

- limitations:
  - The entire process was manual and error-prone. It depended on humans to catch errors and fix them
  - Lack of standardization of data formats, protocols, and processing techniques

2) Early computing
- Defined by:
  - Basic time-based scheduling tools
  - A subsequent rise of proprietary scheduling and workload management tools
  - Dedicated ETL tooling

- Limitations
  - Proprietary software was expensive, closed-source, and resource intensive
  - Schedulers like Cron and Windows Task Scheduler (WTS) lacked features for more complex workloads and general maintainability

 3) Data & Open-Source Renaissance
- Defined by:
  - Increase in data complexity and size
  - Increase in complexity of scheduling and ETL workloads
  - Rise of open-source workflow management projects

- Limitations
  - Some tools were limited to working only within the Hadoop ecosystem
  - Some tools used XML or config files to define workloads
  - Limited dynamism, scalability, and extensibility

4) Modern Data Orchestration
- Defined by:
  - Rise of pipelines-as-code in Python
  - The ability to integrate with hundreds of external systems
  - Time and event-based scheduling
  - Feature rich software with built-in observability and a centralized UI

### What is Airflow?

Apache Airflow is an open-source tool for <span class="rainbow-text">programmatically</span> authoring, scheduling, and monitoring your data pipelines.

- With Airflow data pipelines can be created using code
- Airflow is community driver. Meaning it keeps getting better overtime
- With airflow you have a centralised user interface (UI) where you can manage your workflows from
- Airflow allows for data driven scheduling. Meaning that events can be triggered using events rather than using time as the primary activation method
- Airflow is highly extensible. Meaning it allows for some amazing customisation

### Who uses Airflow?

- Data Scientists
  - Incharge of building machine learning models
- Data Engineer
  - Resolve issues with the pipeline that is used by teams to receive data
- Machine Learning Engineer
  - Usually work on automating steps. Like retraining and validating models when new data is ingested into the system
- Data Analyst
  - productionise SQL query to build dashboards and report based on key metrics

> Note: There are many more people who may interact with airflow. The example above are just a few

### Considerations of using Airflow
#### Streaming
Airflow is designed for batch processing, not streaming processing As it lacks processing and immediate response to data event. Which are essential to streaming.

There is a way to use Airflow with Kafka. Which is a tool to ingest and process in real-time data and then store the data location where Airflow can start workflows based on the data present.

#### Scalability
By default Airflow is scalable, You can execute as many tanks as you like. As long as you have the correct underlying infrastructure. Though for a small team managing such infrastructure can be time consuming and resource-intensive. Airflow does give all the tools a user needs to run as many tasks as they like.

#### Data processing
Airflow is not designed for data processing. It is designed for orchestrating and managing data workflows. That is why if Airflow is used for data processing then possible errors should be expected if enough resources are not available to process the data.

### How does Airflow work?

#### What does DAG stand for?
A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) does not have a cycle. It goes from left to right without going back to left. That is what is meant by it does not cycle (acyclic).

#### What is a <span class="rainbow-text">task</span> in Airflow?
Its a single unit of work in a DAG, represented by a single node in the graph.

#### What is an <span class="rainbow-text">operator</span>?
tasks are defined by operators. An operator defines what the task does

A DAG is a datapipeline, which is composed of tasks. As it is a DAG. There are dependencies between the DAG, which tells you the order of execution.
