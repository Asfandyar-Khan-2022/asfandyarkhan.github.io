# Why <span class="rainbow-text">Orchestration</span>?

It allows different teams to work together towards a unified goal with a single applications rather than using seperate tools to achieve the same goal. It reduces complexity and improves team communication. 

Data orchestration definition:
The <span class="rainbow-text">coordination</span> and <span class="rainbow-text">automation</span> of data flow across various tools and systems to deliver quality data products and analytics.

What is the journey of modern data orchestration?

1) Pre-Unix Era
- Defined by:
  - Manual batch-processing and scheduling
  - The foundation of the idea and need of data orchestration and workflow management starting to form

- limitations:
  - The entire process was manual and error-prone. It depended on humans to catch errors and fix them
  - Lack of standardization of data formats, protocols, and processing techniques

2) Early computing
- Defined by:
  - Basic time-based scheduling tools
  - A subsequent rise of proprietary scheduling and workload management tools
  - Dedicated ETL tooling

- Limitations
  - Proprietary software was expensive, closed-source, and resource intensive
  - Schedulers like Cron and Windows Task Scheduler (WTS) lacked features for more complex workloads and general maintainability

 3) Data & Open-Source Renaissance
- Defined by:
  - Increase in data complexity and size
  - Increase in complexity of scheduling and ETL workloads
  - Rise of open-source workflow management projects

- Limitations
  - Some tools were limited to working only within the Hadoop ecosystem
  - Some tools used XML or config files to define workloads
  - Limited dynamism, scalability, and extensibility

4) Modern Data Orchestration
- Defined by:
  - Rise of pipelines-as-code in Python
  - The ability to integrate with hundreds of external systems
  - Time and event-based scheduling
  - Feature rich software with built-in observability and a centralized UI
